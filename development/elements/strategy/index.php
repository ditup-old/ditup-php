Doing over Talking, antifragility (embrace positive change, deal with negative), Fun over Boredom, Meaning over Money, alternative accessible to everybody,
profit is not primary objective but not a bad thing, be the change you want to see in the world,
don\'t be over-idealistic, be realistic, embrace different opinions, overcome fear, overcome anxiety and depression (Freedom Manifesto by ...)

fix: edit project/ dit
change project->dit
change projects->dits etc.

visibility of project can be set: (everybody, logged in, only members)
searchability of project can be set

it is possible to show if project looks for/accepts people.

projects can be developed slowly: first it is idea or issue; topic; interest. Then it becomes project when people want to develop it.
  * url: /['idea'|'topic'|'interest'|'project']/[url], redirect to current status of the "dit"
  
  
submit your idea to project as an outsider to make it better.

next actions decide.

how to manage admins??
  * you can give up being admin.
  * people can vote admins off
  * no admin -> election or anarchy administration
